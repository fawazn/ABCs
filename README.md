CS101: Basic algorithms and data structures.
 I made these in an effort refresh my fundamentals, but I realize they could be useful for anyone starting out 
 with computer science. My goal was to make the simplest, most self-explanatory implementations of these 
 fundamental algorithms and data structures as possible purely for learning as the ones I found seemed to be
 geared usually for production.
 Written mainly in Python and Javascript.
